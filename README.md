- 👋 Hi, I’m @skycodx
- 👀 I’m interested in web development front and back, love working with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, C/C++, but mainly JavaScript
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Fullstack JavaScript as my core and other programming languages which I'll learn at the university (Cpp, Java, PHP, C language)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate any project related to my learnings, If you need someone to partner up with you, here I am!
